A small explaination about the branches.
AOSiP-P, Superior-P, lineage-16.0 are based on @freemarkw and @Granragw sources so when using them I auggest you to use the vendor tree from @Granrage.
The other branches are based on @SonicBSV sources so I recommend using his vendor tree too

NOTE!!!!!
ALL BRANCHES USES MY KERNEL (Olympian kernel) SO IF TOU WANT TO CHANGE KERNEL YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PROPER MODIFICATIONS AT BoardConfig.mk
